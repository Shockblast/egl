A backup of EGL 0.3.1, as it was, from QuakeSrc

First of all thanks to Paril there has been made a backup of EGL 0.3.1. Which suits as a client/server game dll base, and certain other extensions. More so the importance of this project is to serve, if not even exchanging to Quetoo later on in life, the game SchizoMania.
